            The definition of skincare and a skin care routine will vary between people as it reflects
            their individual skin goals. For example, a skincare regime can range from a 2 step-process
            of face wash and moisturizer to an extensive 8-step process that rotates day and night.
            Skincare products serve various purposes, from hydrating the skin to addressing long-term
            skin-damage. A standard skin care routine typically includes products such as cleansers,
            moisturizers, toners, sunscreens and exfoliants. More specialized products are also available
            to further meet an individual's specific skin goals and concerns.

            The practice of skin care has a history spanning thousands of years, marked by numerous
            industry transformations that have brought new and traditional knowledge. However, this
            abundance of information and exponential increase in available skincare products, has left
            consumers feeling overwhelmed by choices. Many companies profit on this confusion by marketing
            their products as universally effective, but this one-size-fits-all approach often falls short.
            An effective skin care routines must be personalized to align with an individual's preferences,
            lifestyle, and skin needs.

        </p>

        <p>An existing attempt to solve this problem has been done by <a href="https://www.elfcosmetics.com/skin-care-products/skin-care-finder?psafe_param=1&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds">e.l.f. Cosmetics</a>, a cosmetics brand based in Oakland California.
        This company has created a short quiz that asks the user questions about their skin type and daily skincare routine needs in order to provide users with recommendations for different products
        they can use to meet their skin care needs. A limitation of this approach is that it focuses on advertising e.l.f. products and 
        thus may be biased in terms of promoting its own products and making a profit.</p>

        <p>
            The websiteâ€™s target audience are those who are interested in enhancing their skin care
            routine and expanding their knowledge around it. This includes both users that have limited
            knowledge around skincare and those with expertise but want to further enhance their
            understanding. Our website's primary focus is on empowering users to expand their skincare
            knowledge, enabling them to make well-informed decisions when selecting products. This
            approach is universally beneficial, welcoming individuals at any level of familiarity with
            skincare.

        </p>

        <p>The users will begin by taking a quiz (small feature) that will ask them questions about their skin type. The users will then be shown a page that will contain information about different
            products that are recommended to them based on their answers. The user will also be able to filter out specific product suggestions based on brand, price, and ratings (significant feature). 
            From there, they will be able to organize and group products together into a routine based on their skincare needs (significant feature). The user will be prevented
            from grouping products together that should not be used at the same time.</p>

        <p>
            Users will be viewing information around skin types, product ingridents and the purposes.
            A potential dataset that we could use in building the website is a
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eward96/skincare-products-clean-dataset"> skincare product dataset</a>
