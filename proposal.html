        <h1>Project Proposal: Skincare Routine</h1>

        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>An existing attempt to solve this problem has been done by <a href="https://www.elfcosmetics.com/skin-care-products/skin-care-finder?psafe_param=1&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds">e.l.f. Cosmetics</a>, a cosmetics brand based in Oakland California.
        This company has created a short quiz that asks the user questions about their skin type and daily skincare routine needs in order to provide users with recommendations for different products
        they can use to meet their skin care needs. A limitation of this approach is that it focuses on advertising e.l.f. products and 
        thus may be biased in terms of promoting its own products and making a profit.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>The users will begin by taking a quiz (small feature) that will ask them questions about their skin type. The users will then be shown a page that will contain information about different
            products that are recommended to them based on their answers. The user will also be able to filter out specific product suggestions based on brand, price, and ratings (significant feature). 
            From there, they will be able to organize and group products together into a routine based on their skincare needs (significant feature). The user will be prevented
            from grouping products together that should not be used at the same time.</p>
